project:
what i want to investigate is if gender has any impact over the overall power of the superhero
Import, if appropriate for the use case you chose merge, and clean the data.
Build different types of visualizations that you view appropriate (scatter, line plots, box plots etc). What conclusions do you draw from them
Use the visualizations wisely, they should enhance the story, not overload the reader/the person to whom you will present your results.
Find linear relationships in the data by using correlation plots. What story does the correlation plot tell you? What does it not?
Investigate distributions of features (you may want to start from the target).
Use hypothesis tests wisely to see if different groups in the data behave differently (you donâ€™t need to test this for all features, only for a few which make sense to you).


dataset:
multiple csv files
mixed data types


work done:
